        <h1>Quotes for Digital Developers</h1>
    
        <p class="quote">If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.</p>
        <p class="quote">Software and cathedrals are much the same – first we build them, then we pray.</p>
        <p class="quote">Bad code isn't bad, its just misunderstood.</p>
        <p class="quote">The goal of Computer Science is to build something that will last at least until we've finished building it.</p>
        <p class="quote">The software isn't finished until the last user is dead.</p>
        <p class="quote">The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time...The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.</p>
        <p class="quote">Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.</p>
        <p class="quote">Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.</p>
        <p class="quote">Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
        <p class="quote">The hardest part of design ... is keeping features out.</p>
        <p class="quote">Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.</p>
        <p class="quote">Programming is 10% science, 20% ingenuity, and 70% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.</p>
        <p class="quote">The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner </p>
        <p class="quote">The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. Many software tasks have this characteristic because of the sequential nature of debugging.</p>
        <p class="quote">Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</p>
        <p class="quote">Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! </p>
        <p class="quote">A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want. </p>
        <p class="quote">Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to to, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.</p>
        <p class="quote">Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.</p>
        <p class="quote">It's OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn't need to figure out code. You should be able to read it.</p>
        <p class="quote">It's better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait for the first available programmer to become productive.</p>
        <p class="quote">Design and programming are human activities; forget that and all is lost.</p>
        <p class="quote">The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich may find hard to pay.</p>
        <p class="quote">There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.</p>
        <p class="quote">Inside every large program, there is a small program trying to get out.</p>
        <p class="quote">Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: feedback is the treament.</p>
        <p class="quote">When to use iterative development? You should use iterative development only on projects that you want to succeed.</p>
        <p class="quote">Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.</p>
        <p class="quote">It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're looking for it; it's even harder when you've assumed your code is error-free.</p>
        <p class="quote">Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability</p>
        <p class="quote">The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.</p>
        <p class="quote">If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, you are not ready to code it.</p>
        <p class="quote">Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>
        <p class="quote">Every big computing disaster has come from taking too many ideas and putting them in one place.</p>
        <p class="quote">Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.</p>
        <p class="quote">There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third works.</p>
        <p class="quote">For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.</p>
